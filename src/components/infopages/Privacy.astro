        <p>
          This privacy policy applies to the TabTab app (hereby referred to as "Application") for macOS that was created by QI ZHI (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
        </p>
        
        <h3>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h3>
        <p>
          TabTab does not collect any user-identifiable information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the Application. TabTab uses <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TelemetryDeck</a> to collect general usage analytics (such as daily user counts) to monitor app performance and guide future updates. This data is anonymized and contains no personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h3>
        <p>
          This Application does not collect any information about the location of your Mac.
        </p>

        <h3>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h3>
        <p>
          TabTab does not collect user-identifiable information, so no personal data is shared with third parties. The anonymized usage analytics collected through TelemetryDeck are processed according to TelemetryDeck's privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h3>What are my opt-out rights?</h3>
        <p>
          You can stop all collection of information by TabTab easily by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your Mac. Since TabTab only collects anonymized usage analytics, uninstalling will stop this data collection.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <p>
          Since TabTab does not collect personally identifiable information, no user data is stored by the Service Provider. Anonymized analytics data handled by TelemetryDeck is retained in accordance with their privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>
          The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (riccqi@pm.me) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          TabTab is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Since TabTab does not collect any user-identifiable information, there is no risk of your personal data being accessed by unauthorized individuals. The Service Provider (QI ZHI, the developer of TabTab) takes data protection seriously and ensures that any anonymized analytics data is handled securely.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Consent</h3>
        <p>
          By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.
        </p>

        <h3>Contact Us</h3>
        <p>
          If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at riccqi@pm.me.
